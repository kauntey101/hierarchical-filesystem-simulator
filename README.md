# hierarchical-filesystem-simulator

### Project Status : Completed (To be continued) <br />

A simple Linux Hierarchical file system in which you can create files and folders and traverse directories using bash commands. This version is in developement. The filesystem is implemented using BST. This version doesn't have the support for creating links to files and folders and BST isn't an efficient solution. The next release will use either Red Black Trees or AVL Trees for storing the Files and Folders.  

The project is open source so modify it and use it.
